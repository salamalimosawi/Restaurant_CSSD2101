 * </p>
 * <ul>

 *     </li>

 *         A denial is typically implemented by throwing a {@link SecurityException}.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Handlers are arranged into an ordered chain. Only the first handler whose
 * {@code canHandle()} method returns {@code true} will be invoked, ensuring clear,
 * role-based permission resolution.
